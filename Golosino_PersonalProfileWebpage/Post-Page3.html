        <p><span>W</span>ithout a doubt, web development has been the key to success in the digital age, providing the foundation for a great deal of advances and inventions in technology. Web developers have a significant impact on how people interact, transact, and consume information in a world where having an online presence is essential. In addition to completely changing the commercial world, websites' progression from static pages to dynamic, adaptable platforms has also changed how people engage with one another around the world.<br><br>To produce seamless, user-friendly, and secure online experiences, web developers contribute to almost every industry, including e-commerce, social media, education, healthcare, and more. Constant improvements in programming languages, web development frameworks, and design techniques enable the production of complex websites that meet users' ever-increasing needs. Web development's influence is spreading as we manage the complexities of the digital era, promoting a vibrant and connected global community. </p>
        <h2><span><br><br>What are HTML and CSS?</span></h2>
        <p><span>T</span>he foundational languages used to create webpages are HTML and CSS. Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is used to describe the structure of web pages through the use of various tags, such as "heading," "paragraph," and "table." These HTML elements are the fundamental building blocks that are used when creating material for the web.<br><br>Conversely, Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a straightforward language for design created especially for the purpose of styling HTML texts. All of the elements in an HTML document can have their colors, sizes, backgrounds, and layouts changed using CSS. Because styles can be centrally managed and uniformly applied across various web pages, this design language greatly expedites the web development process.<br><br>One of CSS's main capabilities is its ability to govern multiple web pages' layouts at once, providing a more effective means of maintaining design uniformity. This efficiency is made possible via external stylesheets, which hold CSS rules and allow the separation of display and content. This improves the code's organization and makes it simpler to update and maintain the general layout of the website. To put it simply, CSS is essential for improving the consistency and visual attractiveness of web pages and for encouraging a more efficient and manageable development process.</p>
        <h2><span><br><br>What part of the lesson impacted me the most?</span></h2>
        <p><br><span>T</span>he guidance given in the lesson for the initial steps of making a website with a simple program like Notepad struck a chord with me the most. I was about to give up when I failed to understand how to start building a website. Fortunately, the module's beginner-friendly instructions let me get past my initial obstacles and create a website. My desire to pursue a career as a web designer or developer has grown as a result of this experience, and I am truly appreciative of the helpful tips given in this lesson, which have enabled me to start the initial steps toward achieving my goal.<br><br></p>
